        ``hlwcalibrate,<CalibVolt>,<CalibCurr>,<CalibAcPwr>``

        Examples:

        ``hlwcalibrate,229`` to set the current reported voltage to 229V AC

        ``hlwcalibrate,0,0.1`` To set the calibration to report 100 mA as actual current.
        ","
        Will set the used calibration factors to some known current value.
        For example, if the device using this sensor is plugged into mains power, it may report 200 Volt AC, while it actually is 229V.
        So the value given to this command should then be ``229``, since that's what is supposed to be read.

        The last two parameters are optional, but their position determines what unit it represents.
        If the setting for current has to be updated, at least 2 parameters must be given of which the first must then be set to ``0``.

        ``hlwreset``

        ","
        Will reset the calibration values used in the sensor's library.
