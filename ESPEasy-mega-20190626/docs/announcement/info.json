If we could get funding for at least 50% of our time we could make a lot more than with our current 10-15%. Ideal would be 100% funding but we're realistic :) <br><br>We will add extra goodies for those who support us through monthly payments using Patreon.<br><br><br>Thanks for your support (from TD-er and Grovkillen)!",
